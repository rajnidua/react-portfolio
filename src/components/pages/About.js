        I focus on writing clean and modular code which is easily maintainable
        and scalable. My priority lies in taking a mobile first approach using
        functionalities like flexbox, grid and bootstrap and of course media
        queries.I make sure that the biggest impact features are worked on
        first.

        I have built fully functional web applications by integrating third
        party APIs in Javascript, used both object-relational mapping with
        MySQL2(ORM)and object-document-mapping(ODM) with Mongoose.js,
        modularized applications following the Model-View-Controller(MVC)
        paradigm and much more ....
